In this course, you will create relational databases, write SQL statements to extract information to satisfy business reporting requests, create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design databases, and analyze table designs for excessive redundancy. As you develop these skills, you will use either Oracle or MySQL to execute SQL statements and a database diagramming tool such as the ER Assistant to create ERDs. Weâ€™ve designed this course to ensure a common foundation for specialization learners. Everyone taking the course can jump right in with writing SQL statements in Oracle or MySQL.\r\n\r\n## Week 1\r\nCourse Introduction\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Databases and DBMSs\r\n\r\n## Week 2\r\nRelational Data Model and the CREATE TABLE Statement\r\n\r\n## Week 3\r\nBasic Query Formulation with SQL\r\n\r\nExtended Query Formulation with SQL\r\n\r\n## Week 4\r\nNotation for Entity Relationship Diagrams\r\n\r\nERD Rules and Problem Solving\r\n\r\n## Week 5\r\nDeveloping Business Data Models\r\n\r\nData Modeling Problems and Completion of an ERD\r\n\r\n## Week 6\r\nSchema Conversion\r\n\r\n## Week 7\r\nNormalization Concepts and Practice\r\n",
